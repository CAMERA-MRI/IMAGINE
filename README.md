# IMAGINE: Imaging Without Borders: Building a low-cost open-source low-field preclinical MR scanner. 

Imaging without Borders (IMAGINE) summer school is a hybrid training initiative of the Consortium for Advancement of MRI Education and Research in Africa (CAMERA). The summer school is designed to provide skills training to biomedical engineers and MR imaging personnel working in MRI hardware and scanner maintenance in Low- and Middle-income countries (LMICs) in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia or clinicians and researchers interested in low-field and accessible imaging. IMAGINE implements RAD-AID’s Teach-Try-Use strategy, applied in CAMERA’s SPARK AI training program, to rapidly provide MR hardware and engineering competencies in resource-limited settings. In keeping with CAMERA’s training model, IMAGINE will use a combination of case-based and hands-on learning approaches to train a team of engineers, physicists, clinicians, and researchers who will work together as a network to grow their skills and collectively train others. IMAGINE is focused on training next-generation imaging innovators on how to use design thinking strategies and user-centered problem-solving skills to create low-cost open-source tools that will sustainably democratize diagnostic imaging and make it readily accessible to all.
